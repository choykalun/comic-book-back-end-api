# comic-book-back-end-api
My final year project for the Bsc Computer Science degree

------------------Introduction------------------------------

This is a project that includes creating an API server to 
catalogue comic books online. In order to achieve this, a 
strong knowledge of how to create a server is needed. For
this project, I have decided to use python for implementation
and I will also try to use HTTP/3 request as opposed to HTTP/2
to see how difficult it is to create a server as such. The 
QUIC protocol was introduced in 2012 and announced publicly in 2013.
